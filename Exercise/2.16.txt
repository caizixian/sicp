In general, it can be shown that the exact range of values can be achieved, if each variable appears only once and if f is continuous inside the box. However, not every function can be rewritten this way.

The dependency of the problem causing over-estimation of the value range can go as far as covering a large range, preventing more meaningful conclusions.
