Explicit dispatch: not-flexible

Message-passing style: In order to add new types, a make-* procedure must be written. In order to add new operations, new dispatching rules must be written.

Data-directed style: In order to add new types or new operations, corresponding procedures should be added to the table of operations.

Both Message-passing style and Data-directed style are appropriate.
